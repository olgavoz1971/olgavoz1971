About Me

I’m Olga Vozyakova, an adult 🙂 PhD student at Pavol Jozef Šafárik University in Košice, Slovakia.

My field of interest is astrophysics, and I enjoy tinkering with code.

Currently, I’m concerned with variable star light curves.

I’m working on the Slovak Virtual Observatory project, where we focus primarily on publishing time-series data from small and medium-sized telescopes.

I believe that not only data from large projects matter — there are plenty of hidden treasures scattered across personal computers and local archives, and they deserve to be accessible to the variable star community.

On GitHub, you’ll find a mix of experiments and drafts related to different stages of my life.
