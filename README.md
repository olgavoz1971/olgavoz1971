About Me
Hi there! ğŸ‘‹

I'm Olga Vozyakova, a PhD student at Pavol Jozef Å afÃ¡rik University in KoÅ¡ice, Slovakia.
My field of interest is astrophysics, and I love tinkering with code to build cool tools and make data crunching a breeze.
ğŸ”­ Currently, I'm working on the Slovak Virtual Observatory project, focusing on creating accessible tools for variable stars lightcurves analysis
ğŸŒ± I enjoy learning new things
In my GitHub repositories, you'll find some of my projects. Feel free to explore and reach out if you share similar interests! ğŸ˜Š
